# kickstarter_analysis
1. Overview of Project
The goal of thisproject was to analyse the history of kickstarter compaigns across differnt timelines, statues, industries and locations to determine trends and provide a recommendation to a client based on our findings. 

2. Analysis and Challenges
Firstly, to get the big picture, I took a high level view of the worksheet and begin , resizing rows, formating  results to highlights what campigns where successful, failed or canceled or still live. I also reformated the timestamps and separating the categories into "Parent Categories" and "Subcategories"

in order to view the data easier and allow for filtering to produce more specific results. From there, we could generate more targeting pivot tables to hone the view and focus on the types of campaigns the client wanted. By creating a chart that shows the outcomes by launch date, we could observe and analyse a campaign lyfecycle and learn when and where the clients perfered campigns performed the best.

3. Results
Our analysis shows that launching a Theater type campign is a viable option and that May is the best month to launch and that January is the wordt month to launch. Our data shows that 61% of campaigns in the Theater / Play industry are successful and that $4,000 goal is a feasible goal.  I would recommend commiting to a goal of up to $15,000. 

Summary of limitations and Difficulties
Our data does not show analysis based on every country. It would be useful to see how each campaign performed in different areas of the world. It also does not show the length of the campaigns compared to the successful and failed outcomes. It would be also use to dive into the length of the campain vs  the campign goals and outcomes.

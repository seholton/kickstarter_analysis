# kickstarter_analysis
1. Overview of Project
The goal of thisproject was to analyse the history of kickstarter compaigns across differnt timelines, statues, industries and locations to determine trends and provide a recommendation to a client based on our findings. 

2. Analysis and Challenges
Firstly, to get the big picture, I takk a high level view of the worksheet and begin , resizing rows, formating  results to highlights what campigns where successful, failed or canceled or still live. I also reformated the timestamps and separating the categories into "Parent Categories" and "Subcategories"  in order to view the data easier and allow for filtering to produce more specific results. From there, we could generate more targeting pivot tables to hone the view and focus on the types of campaigns the client wanted. By creating a chart that shows the outcomes by launch date, we could observe and analyse a campaig lyfecycle and learn when and where the clients perfered campigns performed the best : GB with a launch date in May.
